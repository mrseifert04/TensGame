Tens! Game + AI

This is a recreation of the mobile game Tens! by Kwalee. 
I love this game so I wanted to code a version of it 
myself. I also wanted to see if I could make an AI that 
is better at the game than me. 

Game Instructions: 
The goal of the game is to get the highest score 
possible before you can no longer place any dice pieces 
on the board. The game starts with a blank 5x5 board and
you are given 3 pieces that could be a singular dice, 
two dice stacked vertically or horizontally, or three
dice in one of the following shapes: ﹂」﹁「. You must 
place each of the pieces on the board, and if one of the
rows/columns adds up to 10, it will clear that row/
column and add points for however many dice were in
that row/column. Once all pieces are placed, 3 more 
pieces will be generated. If you can no longer place any 
pieces, the game will end. You can score extra points if 
you clear multiple lines at once, clearing two lines 
sequentially, or clearing the board completely.
